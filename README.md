## Synacor Challenge

A rough-but-working Python implementation of the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/). Don't explore unless you want spoilers, I guess. 

For funsies, I made it so it could [run as a single executable](https://github.com/sjml/synacor-challenge/releases/latest) with [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer). Should be runnable on x86 Macs running Catalina but I literally have not tried it on anything else. 

The Python should be pretty usable, though. Just use the `requirements.txt` file.
